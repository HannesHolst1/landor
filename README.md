# Welcome to Landor (Calrissian)!

This Web App is an exercise of mine. I wanted to make use of GrapesJS which is a cool "drag & drop" website editor.

## What is Landor?

This Web App allows you to create a Landingpage which is served at `http://host/username`. You can create multiple versions and select which version you want to serve. Images are stored as Base64 in the HTML-file.
Btw: Admins are theoritcally also users. But the Landingpage of an admin wouldn't be served.

## How to get started?

On the left, click on "Edit pages" and then click "Create!" to create your first version of your Landingpage.

## Could Landor be better?

Yes, definitely! Before Landor could be an actual product, A LOT of work has to be done. But I wanted primarly integrate GrapesJS only.
